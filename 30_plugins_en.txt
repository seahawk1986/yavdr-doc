=== Plugins ===
The VDR itself focuses on the core functions such as DVB reception, recordings an a simple EPG administration. Any additional functionality is provided by plugins.
The page http://vdr-wiki.de/wiki/index.php/Plugins[Plugins] in the VDR Wiki provides a good overview about all plugins and their compatibility with the VDR that is used in yaVDR.
Most of the compatible plugins are available in the yaVDR package sources and can be conveniently added to your system via the <<wfe-packages,Web frontend>> or the <<install-packages,Shell>>.
