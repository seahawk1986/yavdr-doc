==== RestfulAPI Plugin ====

{version} introduces the newly developed RestfulAPI plugin, which was designed as an alternative to (or also extension of) <<svdrp,SVDRP>>.
Instead of direct TCP communication, it supports interacting with the VDR by HTTP requests. The supported formats for VDR responses are HTML, XML and JSON.

.Advantages:
* The transmission of huge amounts of data (e.g. EPG entries of a channel) is faster
* VDR is not blocked by the request, and multiple clients can send requests at the same time
* It is easier to process the data responded by VDR
* Web-OSD for the VDR (still in development) - each web browser with JS support will be able to draw the OSD of the VDR
* Furhermore, EPG images and channel logos can be easily fetched from the VDR

.Disadvantages:
* The plugin is quite young. Some of the established functions of <<svdrp,SVDRP>> (esp. for the direct control of other plugins) are missing right now
* Also, there is not a huge number of clients that take advantage of the plugin
