[[xvdr]]
==== xvdr Plugin ====
The xvdr plugin enables experimental version of XBMC with PVR support to facilitate VDR as a PVR backend. At the moment, the functions span Live TV, EPG, administration of timers as well as access to VDR recordings. Further functions, e.g. using cut marks, the cutting of recordings or the change of VDR settings from within XBMC is not supported yet.
The xvdr plugin supports multiple users. Thus, several XBMC clients can access and VDR at the same time.

===== Access Control =====
The access from remote clients needs to be specified in the file '/var/lib/vdr/plugins/xvdr/allowed_hosts.conf'. The syntax of this file is identical to the <<svdrp-config, svdrphosts.conf>> file:
[NOTE]
.Remote Access
=====================================================================
