=== Linux Basics ===

yaVDR is based on http://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu Linux]. Most of the configuration can be in the *webinterface,web frontend*. More complex settings or fixing of errors may require to change settings manually. Thus, it is recommended that you learn a few basic commands of a Ubuntu linux http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Shell[shell].

[[rights]]
==== Permissions ====

****
.TODO
sudo
users and groups
chown
chmod

[[sudo]]
===== sudo - Super User =====

In Ubuntu, the root account does not have a password by default. The command *sudo* enables all members of the group *admin* to run commands with root privileges. 

[[manpages]]
==== Manpages ====
If you like to learn more about a command or a program, it is useful to read the particular http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/man[manpage] footnote:[the manual]. It summarizes informations about the syntax of the command, functions and capabilites of the program. By default, manpages will be displayed with the program *less*. In less, navigation is done with the arrow keys, PageUp & PageDown, space key etc. footnote:[more information is available in the manpage of less, see the following example ;)]

Press *q* to quit the display of the manpage.

==== Package Management ====
Ubuntu Linux facilitates the http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Paketverwaltung[package management] http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool[APT]. This supports the adminstration, installation and update of software package, which are hosted in package repositories. There are several frontend for APT available. The instructions below are limited to the command line interface <<apt-get, apt-get>>. Another frontend, which can also be used from a shell, is http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/aptitude[aptitude].

[[apt-get]]
===== apt-get =====
http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/apt-get[apt-get] is the recommended package management for yaVDR. Prior to the installation of new packages, make sure that the package lists are updated and all available updates are installed. Otherwise, conflicts between different package versions or non-resolveable dependencies might occur.

sudo apt-get install package1 package2 package3	  <2>
sudo apt-get install vim			  <3>
----
<1> Installs a package named "packagename"

APT stores the packages locally when they are fetched from the package repositories. These packages will be removed.
