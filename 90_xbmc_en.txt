=== XBMC ===

We recommend to read in the http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Main_Page[XBMC wiki] to get familiar with the control and complex configuration options of XBMC.

==== Configuration Files ====

XBMC store its global configuration files, addons and skins underneath '/usr/share/xbmc/' and '/usr/lib/xbmc/'. In addition, there are user settings stored in the '.xbmc/' directory in the *$HOME* directory. For yaVDR, XBMC runs in the context of user *vdr*. Thus, these user settings are stored in '/var/lib/vdr/.xbmc/'. The user settings have priority over the global settings.

==== Log ====

XBMC writes its log to '/var/lib/vdr/.xbmc/temp/xbmc.log'. Please <<posting_files,post>> this log file together with a description of your problem in case that XBMC crashs or malefunctions occur.

==== Remote Control, Keyboard and Mouse ====

The keyboard is configured in the file '/usr/share/xbmc/system/keymaps/keyboard.xml'. If you like to customize this, please create a copy of this file to the user settings in '/var/lib/vdr/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/' and edit it there. Refer to the http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Keymap.xml[Keymap.xml in XBMC wiki] for details about the syntax of the file.

The configuration of the remote control behavior in XBMC is done via two templated files: 

[horizontal]
Lircmap.xml:: The file '/var/lib/vdr/.xbmc/userdata/Lircmap.xml' maps key names sent by eventlircd onto XBMC-internal key names.footnote:[http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Userdata/lircmap.xml]
remote.xml:: In '/var/lib/vdr/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/remote.xml', the function of the keys will be mapped depending on the particular context in XBMC.
